    <p>My aim is to get better at understanding good UI/UX for a user where we follow a hook model cycle by Nir Eyal to design a better product for users. I have worked with Zomato and Adobe as a Software Engineer in the past two years. I am an open source enthusiast and love contributing to various open source projects in my free time. I have contributed to KDE, Mozilla Firefox, WikiRead and CPython. I like playing around with javascript, have experience in working with React, Redux and vanilla javascript. I started web development back in 2013 in my college where I worked with a startup called Shiplock. I have been hooked on to the web development and exploring new horizons since then.</p>
